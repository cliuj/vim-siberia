# vim-siberia
A vim theme revolving around the snowy fields of siberia at night with an aurora borealis in the sky 

# ***Currently a work in progress***  
  
If you find the colors to look weird, it's because I use colors from my Xresources hex colors to generate colors that are not from xterm's 256 colors. You can find the colors from my Xresources' file (urxvt specific) here:  
https://github.com/jliu2179/dotfiles/blob/master/.Xresources  

I will see if I can generate a version that uses only the 256 colors, but I recommend using GVim for the best colors results if you do not wish to change your Xresources.  
  
## **To do**:
[] Upload screenshots
[] Fix cosmetic issues  
[] Tweak colors for different languages  
[] Lower color usage  
[] Make version not rely on Xresources
[] C/C++ support  
[] Clean up  
  
**Finished**:  
[**x**] Upload base file to work off
